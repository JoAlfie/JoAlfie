metaDescription: "Creating a stable and secure platform that provides the latest metal prices from the LMEâ€™s trillion-dollar metal trading centre"

The LME wanted to enable its variety of users to access pertinent information in the most efficient manner, helping them to make informed trading and product decisions while educating them about the metals market.

I led the front end side of integrating with their data provider to display both streamed 15-minute delayed last trade prices as well as day-delayed market data such as LME Official Prices and LME Closing Prices in various formats, created using Vue.js and Charts.js. I also worked closely with the design team to ensure the UI was modern, clean and visually interesting without distracting from the transferral of important information.
