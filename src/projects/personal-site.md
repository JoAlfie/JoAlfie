My [old portfolio site](http://joalfiedesign.uk) was incredibly outdated - I hadn't touched it since I graduated in 2017. It is still very design-focused, and my website-building skills have improved a lot since then!

I challenged myself to learn something new in order to build myself a new portfolio site. As I already had experience in React (mostly through React Native), and was interested in the concept of static site generators, I decided to use Gatsby. It's been a very fun challenge, and I've found Gatsby fairly easy to get to grips with, although I'd love to dive deeper into using it with a CMS.
