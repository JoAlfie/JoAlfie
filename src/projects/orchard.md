As part of the Orchard Brand revamp / relaunch, the website was in need of a refresh. The idea was to use a clean, minimal look to let the work speak for itself, while also portraying the friendly, people-centric tone of the brand.

I was a part of the project from the beginning to work with the designers and marketing department on what we needed from the site, which helped inform the design and build of the project.

We used Symphony CMS as a starting point to build the site, as it was already in use in the current site, and everyone was well aquianted with it, reducing the learning curve for those updating the website and also speeding up the development process.

A particular highlight for me was building the 'Our People' page, with two types of Javascript search/filtering, and the fun image-switch when you hover over a team member.
