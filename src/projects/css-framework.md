After working on a few projects with the Orchard team I knew two things: Bootstrap had far too much code for what we needed, and Flexbox Grid had too many bugs for my liking.

As a challenge to myself I used my colleague's preferred CSS frameworks as an inspiration to create my own, perfect for our use-case. As a team we use Less to write our CSS, so I utilised it's abilities to easily create reusable classes based on variables set in the main config file. This allowed us to set specifics for the project, and let the code generate classes for us.

I also included some of the third-party code we used a lot, so that we had a quick-start project to begin prototyping with.
