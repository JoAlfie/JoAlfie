metaDescription: "Consolidating six sites into one scaleable component library"
---

We consolidated six customer facing websites into one Sitecore instance and successfully launched four new Marsh Commercial sites. The websites are now controlled by a single strategic platform approach and a scalable component library that works across all sites, enabling Marsh Commercial to deliver a consistent digital experience. I led the front end approach to creating a scalable theming system which could be applied across the component library, giving each brand site its own personality whilst maintaining continuity and ease for content editors and users across the sites.
