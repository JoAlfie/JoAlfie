A fibre arts discord server I'm in was keeping a google doc list of "Knitting Achievements" for people to tick off. As a hobby project I decided to create an interactive web based version for people to be able to easily save their own progress. The checklist allows users to check off achievements, keep notes on the project the achievement is related to, and has some fun easter eggs. The React app is styled with Bulma for easy prototying, uses a [Solid](https://solidproject.org/) data storage system to avoid the need for centralised storage of user data, and it hosted on Netlify.
